## What is Docker?
  - Docker is a containerization platform that enables you to build, test, and deploy software solutions; quickly and reliably
  - A Docker host can run multiple containers, with a degree of isolation between the containers
  - A containers is a standard unit which provides a single point of service
  - Multiple containers when provided as a Service, create a scalable and reliable solution

## What are Containers?
  - A running instance of a Docker image
  - Packages all the code and its dependencies
  - OS level virtualization; containers share the operating system of the host

## Docker vs. Virtual Machine
  - Docker containers are generally understood as Lightweight Virtual Machine, but that's not correct
  - The fundamental of the underlying architecture is different
        - Virtual machines run on virtualized hardware resources, with each VM having its own OS
        - Docker Containers share the host OS kernel, with each container having its own set of binaries and libraries
        - VM is a abstraction of physical hardware; whereas, containers are an abstration at application layer

## Why Docker?
Benefits:
  - It's a convenient way to package applications (all dependencies, libraries, and prerequisites are already bundle into the image / no need manual work / fit well with the CI/CD model
  - Image can create ready-to-run containerized applications
  - Provides consistent computing environment
  - Works well in On-premise and Cloud environments
  - Lightweight and faster alternative to virtual machines

Advantages Over Competitors
  - Open-source
  - Supported on variety of Linux distributions (MacOS, MS Windows)
  - Supported by major public cloud vendors - AWS, IBM, MS Azure, GCP
  - Works well with Orcherstration Engines like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes
  - Red Hat's OpenShift PaaS integrates Docker in its offering
  - Main contributors: Docker team, Cisco, Google, Huawei, IBM, MS, RedHat

## Docker Architecture

Docker Engine
  - Docker engine gets insetalled on the Docker host
  - It's a client-server architecture based application which has the following components
    - A daemon process (dockerd), which is a continuous running program
    - Rest API to communicate with the daemon process and provide instructions
    - Client (docker command), CLI

Docker Objects
  - Images: Read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container
  - Container: Runnable instance of an image
  - Networks: Network interface to connect the container to external networks using the host machine's network connection
  - Volumes: Mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by containers
  - Registry: Private or public registry of Docker images
  - Services: enable multi-host, multi-container deployment

Container Format
  - The default container format is libcontainer and combines the following:
    - Namespaces
        - Wraps a global system resource in an abstraction (isolated workspace)
        - In short, limits what a container can see (own view of the system)
        - Process ID, N/W Interface, Inter-process Communication, Filesystem mount points
    - Control Groups (cgroups)
        - Share available hardware resources to containers and optionally enforce limits and constraints
        - In short, limits how much a container can use (metering & limiting)
        - Memory, CPU, block I/O, network
    - Union file system (UnionFS)
        - Operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast
        - Union mounting is a way of combining multiple directories into one that appears to contain their combined contents
